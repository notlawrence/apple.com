<h1 class="page-title"style= "color: black;">Minecraft</h1>
	<h1 class="des"style= "color: black;">its a game where you can survive on your own world and create new structure. umm you can also play with your friends. There is also a minecraft education version, but its a little boring. You can play on computer or phone whatever you like. You have to pay for the game but it should be okay in your Lai C money.
